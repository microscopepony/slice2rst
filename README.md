slice2rst is a simple Slice to restructured text transformer, based on
slice2xml (originally written by mwilson1962@gmail.com under the GPL v3
license).
It is built using the [unsupported] Slice parser code in the Ice code base, and
has been tested with Ice 3.3.1 and 3.4.2.

Usage: slice2rst [-Idir] <slice file>

The -Idir option lets you add directories for other .ice files you may
choose to include in your project (exactly as slice2cpp does it).

The program outputs the to stdout.

To build you will may need to set ICE_HOME, MCPP_HOME, and COMPILER in your
environment and invoke make or gmake.
