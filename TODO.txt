Assuming this is worth continuing with:

* Clean up the code
* Documentation
* Decide whether comments should use Sphinx or limited Javadoc style tags.
  Currently the following @ tags are used: @param @return @see @link
  It should be relatively simple to parse these are convert to sphinx format   in the output, so comments remain compatible with the Javadoc style.
