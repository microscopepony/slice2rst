Slice2xml is a simple Slice to XML transformer.  It is built using the
[unsupported] Slice parser code in the Ice code base.  This version is
built against Ice 3.3.1.

Usage: slice2xml [-Idir] <slice file>

The -Idir option lets you add directories for other .ice files you may
choose to include in your project (exactly as slice2cpp does it).

The program outputs the XML to stdout.

To build you will need to set ICE_HOME, MCPP_HOME, and COMPILER in your
environment and invoke make or gmake.

I do not have a Visual Studio setup for the program - if anyone cares, I
can do it.

The simple run script will transform 'testInput.ice' to XML.
